PROJECT TITLE: Capstone Project!!

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To synthesize various concepts learned throughout the year while researching and accomplishing new and different concepts. I accomplished this through the use of a java library called JFugue. This library already has the necessary code to produce sound in a musical form. It required extensive research and I had to get used to all the different aspects of writing the music in a String form. I first transposed the music into code form where I could play the song with a simple main method. I then converted that song into a GUI program that allows the user to pick and choose the different instruments of the song that they wanted to hear. This required more research and also touched base on some of the things we did in class this year. The end product is a two class program including the MusicPlayer and the MusicCreator. You can guess what they do based on the names and the documentation within them. I hope you enjoy my twist on a Foreigner song Jukebox Hero. It is slightly delayed in some parts due to the way that the library is designed. It is unfortunately unavoidable.

VERSION or DATE: 04/23/2015

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Make sure you add the .java JFuge file (found in the Capstone folder) to your libraries in preferences before you attempt. Then run the main method in the MusicPlayer class and begin!

AUTHORS: Fin Malone

USER INSTRUCTIONS: Please don’t forget to add the instruments you want before you press play. The song can’t play if you don’t select anything.

SUGGESTION: First add all the instruments so that you can hear the song in its entirety, then play around with the different combinations of instrument tracks.
